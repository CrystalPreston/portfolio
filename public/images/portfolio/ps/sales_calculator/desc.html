<p>The Sales Calculator is a locally running app.  It allows a user to fill in a form for a sales quote.  Following this, the user can automatically generate a PDF quote which can be sent directly to the customer.  Also, the user has the ability to view and edit a price list. </p>
<p>Written by me: HTML, CSS, Javascript, VBA (word macros to generate PDF file) and the .NET framework.</p>
